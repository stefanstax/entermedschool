                    <p>An excellent source of information that fits perfectly with the IMAT test syllabus, organized by topics in order of importance. The material is written in an understandable way with videos and pictures that illustrate the material in an easy-to-understand way. The site has been a major source of information for me especially in biology studies, but may completely help with other exam topics.

                    <p>First of all, the guides on registration for the IMAT, what IMAT is like etc. were very helpful, they gave me good insight as the process is very unclear at first. The IMAT course was very good on biology, it covers everything you need with extra topics that may interest you (it is mentioned that these topics are extra and you will not need them for the IMAT before you start reading). Chemistry is a bit less polished and there's an abundance of information, but still covers every topic you'll need, and seeing as they're not labeled "(Final Version)" I believe Ari will polish that also. I'm not sure if I would've passed without EMS & its courses, but it would've been very hard if EMS wasn't there for me. Outside of guides and courses, EMS helped me meet other people who are taking the exams, and that was great insight! And let's get to the staff, I don't know many of them, but Ari especially, the founder, is kind on superhuman levels. He's constantly working to improve his work, and helping others to succeed in getting the education they want and deserve. Honestly, thank you so much to EMS staff & Ari for helping me and other students out. This project is amazing.
