        choose to publish your location in your profile. The information posted about you by other people who use our
        forum may also be public. For example, other people may mention you using @nickname in posts.</h6>

    <h6>You are responsible for your topics, posts, and other information you provide through our services, and you
        should think carefully about what you make public, especially if it is sensitive information.</h6>

    <p>You may choose to register connecting your account to accounts on another service (e.g. Facebook login), and that
        other service may send us information about your account on that service. We use the information we receive to
        provide you features like cross-posting or cross-service authentication, and to operate our community. We create
        new account in our community for you based on your third party account information you share.</p>

    <h4>1.2 Contact Information</h4>
    <p>We use your contact information, such as your email address, to authenticate your account and keep it – and our
        services – secure, and to help prevent spam, fraud, and abuse. We also use contact information to personalize
        our services, enable certain account features for example, for login verification, reset password, to send you
        information about our community and notify on new replies to your subscribed forums and topics. You can also
        unsubscribe from any email notifications.</p>

        respond to your request.</p>

    <h4>1.3 Private Messages and Non-Public Communications</h4>
    <p>We provide certain features that let you communicate more privately or control who sees your content. For example
        if forum admin is enabled, you can check the “Set Topic Private” checkbox when you create a topic or click on
        the “Private” button of your topic first post, or use the Private Messages to have non-public conversations. In
        these cases we will store and process your communications and information related to them. This includes message
        content, images, information about whom you have communicated with and when to better understand the use of our
        community, to protect the safety and review the reported messages. We share the content of your Private Messages
        with the people you’ve sent them to; we do not use them to serve you ads. When you use features like Private
        Messages to communicate, remember that recipients have their own copy of your communications on EnterMedSchool
        Forum – even if you delete your copy of those messages from your account – which they may duplicate, store, or
        re-share.</p>

    <p>As this website might contain errors and bugs – remember that even private messages and private information might
        be visible due to an error. You take full responsibility for using our platform acknowledging that the platform
        is made by a small group and while we try our best – we might still have some bugs and errors that can cause
        your private communication and data to be visible to the public. Please be cautious when using our website.</p>

                request to disclose your personal data.</p>

            <h4>2.4 Non-Personal Information</h4>

                particular link (number of topic views) or voted on a poll in a topic (even if only one did).</p>

            <h2>3. How to access and control your information</h2>
            <h4>3.1 Accessing or Rectifying Your Personal Data</h4>
            <p>You have the right to request a copy of your information, to object to our use of your information. If
                you have registered an account on our community, we provide you with tools and account settings to
                access, correct, delete, or modify the personal data you provided to us and associated with your
                account. You can request for downloading your account information, including your created content
                (posts). You also can request correction, deletion, or modification of your personal data.</p>

            <p>Your request and choices may be limited in certain cases: for example, if fulfilling your request would
                reveal information about another person, or if you ask to delete information which we or your
                administrator are permitted by law or have compelling legitimate interests to keep. Where you have asked
                us to share data with third parties, for example, by installing third-party apps, you will need to
                contact those third-party service providers directly to have your information deleted or otherwise
                restricted.</p>

            <h4>3.2 Deletion Your Personal Data</h4>
            <p>You can request for your account deletion. This will include personal data, profile data, created
                content, logs, etc… Cookies should be deleted from your side. Almost all browsers have an option to
                delete cookies.</p>

            <p>You can easily do it by sending an email to ari@entermedschool.com using the same email you registered
                with. Your account will be deleted in 5-7 business days. </p>

            <p>Keep in mind that search engines and other third parties may still retain copies of your public
                information, like your profile information, even after we/you have deleted the information from our
                community.</p>

            <h4>3.3 Restrict Processing</h4>
            <p><b>3.3.1 Request that we stop using your information</b>: In some cases, you may ask us to stop
                accessing, storing, using and otherwise processing your information where you believe we don’t have the
                appropriate rights to do so. For example, if you believe a community account was created for you without
                your permission or you are no longer an active user, you can request that we delete your account
                (contact us). Where you gave us consent to use your information for a limited purpose, you can contact
                us to withdraw that consent, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place at the
                time. You can also opt-out of our use of your information for marketing purposes by contacting us. When
                you make such requests, we may need time to investigate and facilitate your request. If there is delay
                or dispute as to whether we have the right to continue using your information, we will restrict any
                further use of your information until the request is honored or the dispute is resolved, provided your
                administrator does not object (where applicable). If you object to information about you being shared
                with a third-party app, please disable the app or contact your administrator to do so.</p>

            <p><b>3.3.2 Opt out of communications</b>: You may opt out of receiving email notifications related to your
                subscribed forums and posts or promotional communications from us by using the unsubscribe link within
                each email, updating your subscription settings in My Profile > Subscription page, or by contacting us
                as provided below to have your contact information removed from our promotional email list or
                registration database.</p>

            <h4>3.4 Data portability</h4>
            <p>Data portability is the ability to obtain some of your information in a format you can keep in your
                devices or share with other communities. Depending on the context, this applies to some of your
                information, but not to all of your information. Should you request it, we will provide you with an

                to secure your data. While we implement safeguards designed to protect your information, no security
                system is impenetrable and due to the inherent nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that data,
                during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our systems or otherwise in our care, is
                absolutely safe from intrusion by others.</p>
